# The-Disintegration-News

Last October 7, the internet connection to G@za was drastically affected, thus compromising internal and external communications. In a fully interconnected society such as ours, where online news and shared content is direct and immediate proof of what is happening, this is just another step towards complete censorship.

We are witnessing rapid communicative disintegration, we are witnessing an attempt to control the world's public narrative, we are witnessing the systematic suppression of oppositional voices.

Based on the work The desintegration Loops by William Basinski, the website "The Disintegration news" is a temporary artifact intended to make the user reflect with respect to what is happening in contemporary world affairs. In other words, it is a news feed that slowly desintegrates to the sound of bombs.

The site is intended to disappear in a short period.
